# API Contracts: Combine Transaction Cards

No new or modified API contracts. This feature is a frontend-only presentational refactor.

All existing endpoints remain unchanged:

- `GET /api/children/{id}/transactions` — recent transactions
- `GET /api/children/{childId}/upcoming-allowances` — upcoming allowance payments
- `GET /api/children/{childId}/interest-schedule` — interest schedule
- `GET /api/children/{id}/balance` — balance and interest rate
